var content = 'In C++ the default return type of main is void, i.e. main() will not return anything. But, in C default return type of main is int, i.e. main() will return an integer value by default.\n\nIn C, void main() has no defined(legit) usage, and it can sometimes throw garbage results or an error. However, main() is used to denote the main function which takes no arguments and returns an integer data type.\n\nThe definition is not and never has been C++, nor has it even been C. See the ISO C++ standard 3.6.1[2] or the ISO C standard 5.1.2.2.1. for more.\n\nvoid main(){\n\n// Body\n\n}\n\nA conforming implementation accepts the formats given below:\n\nint main(){ \n\n// Body\n\n}\n\nand\n\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]){\n\n// Body\n\n}\n\nA conforming implementation may provide more versions of main(), but they must all have return type int. The int returned by main() is a way for a program to return a value to “the system” that invokes it. On systems that don’t provide such a facility the return value is ignored, but that doesn’t make “void main()” legal C++ or legal C. \n\nExample:\n\n// CPP Program to demonstrate main() with\n\n// return type\n\n#include <iostream>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Driver Code\n\nint main()\n\n{\n\n    cout<< "This program returns the integer value 0\n";\n\n}\n\nOutput\n\nThis program returns the integer value 0'
