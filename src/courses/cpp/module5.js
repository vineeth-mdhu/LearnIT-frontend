var content = 'C++ comes with libraries that provide us with many ways for performing input and output. In C++ input and output are performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams.\n\nInput Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device(for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.\n\nOutput Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device( display screen ) then this process is called output.\n\nHeader files available in C++ for Input/Output operations are: \n\n1.iostream: iostream stands for standard input-output stream. This header file contains definitions of objects like cin, cout, cerr, etc.\n\n2.iomanip: iomanip stands for input-output manipulators. The methods declared in these files are used for manipulating streams. This file contains definitions of setw, setprecision, etc.\n\n3.fstream: This header file mainly describes the file stream. This header file is used to handle the data being read from a file as input or data being written into the file as output.\n\n4.bits/stdc++: This header file includes every standard library. In programming contests, using this file is a good idea, when you want to reduce the time wasted in doing chores; especially when your rank is time sensitive. To know more about this header file refer this article.\n\nIn C++ after the header files, we often use ‘using namespace std;‘. The reason behind it is that all of the standard library definitions are inside the namespace std. As the library functions are not defined at global scope, so in order to use them we use namespace std. So, that we don’t need to write STD:: at every line (eg. STD::cout etc.). To know more refer this article.'
